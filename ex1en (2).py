#Task fizz-buzz:
#You have three numbers, they are entered from the console.
# The first number is called fizz, the second is called buzz.
# To the third, it is necessary to add up from the unit.
# Looking at the current number if it is a multiple of fizz â€“
# should output F instead of a number. If the number is a multiple of buzz -
# should output B instead of a number.
# If the number is a multiple of both fizz and buzz, FB should be displayed.
# If it is not a multiple of anything, we output the number.
# And so - until the third entered number is reached.
#Example of condition and result: Numbers 2, 5, 18 are entered
# The conclusion should be as follows: 1 F 3 F B F 7 F 9 FB 11 F 13 F B F 17 F
